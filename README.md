# computing-sum-of-a-column
Many a times, we need to compute on columns of the table with some constraints. Here I have tried to simplify it by computing sum of a column using multi-dimensional arrays.
given the condition that if any item is a column does not contain a numeric value, that column is not computed and we go ahead to the next column. Suggestions are welcome.
